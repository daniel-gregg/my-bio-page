  <p>
    Hi! <br/>
    For three days a week (on average) I am a researcher in rural development 
    focusing on smallholder-inclusive interventions and policies. <br/>
    For my remaining time I:
    <ul>
      co-own/operate a cafe and smallholder ethical coffee supply chain;
      am finalising construction of a motorhome based on a 4x4 mercedes sprinter truck;
      continue to work on renovations at home and establishing a nice 'tropical' garden, and;
      seek to spend time surfing/paddleboarding/etc. 
      Oh, and working on homework for the coding bootcamp!
    </ul>  
  </p>
